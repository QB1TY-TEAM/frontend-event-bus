[🇷🇺 Читать на русском](README.ru.md)

A lightweight, strictly typed, and framework-agnostic state bridge for micro-frontends and isolated web components. 

Seamlessly synchronize state and exchange events across **React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte** instances residing on the same page—without polluting the global `window` object or relying on heavy state management libraries.

## 🚀 Motivation

If you work with micro-frontends, you know the architectural pain: *How do you make widgets written in different frameworks communicate with each other safely?*

- Native `CustomEvent`s quickly turn into an untyped chaos.
- Dragging Redux, Zustand, or Vuex to the top global level creates version conflicts, memory leaks, and ecosystem lock-in.

**`frontend-micro-bridge`** solves this by providing a lightweight, isolated Event Bus that bridges the gap between frameworks natively.

## ✨ Features

- **Framework-Agnostic Core**: Written in pure TypeScript. Works anywhere.
- **Out-of-the-box Wrappers**: Native hooks/composables for React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular.
- **Strictly Typed**: Full TypeScript support for event names and payloads.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Weighs practically nothing. Does not bloat your bundle.
- **Isolated Contexts**: No `window` object pollution. Safe for complex enterprise environments.

## 📦 Installation

npm install frontend-micro-bridge
# or
yarn add frontend-micro-bridge
